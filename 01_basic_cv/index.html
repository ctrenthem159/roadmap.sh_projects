                <h1>Chris Trenthem</h1>
                <h2>Accountant / Software Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve been working in various accounting jobs for over a
                    decade, with a detour into logistics for a few years. My
                    experiences in a wide variety of companies and environments
                    have equipped me with a unique insight into a large variety
                    of perspectives, management styles, and philosophies
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my experience in accounting, I have had a
                    lifelong passion for technology and began learning
                    programming while I was still in elementary school. After
                    many years on and off, I've developed a wide varity of
                    skills as a developer, including working on various open
                    source projects in Python and web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and
                    numerous pets or tinkering with my home lab. I compete in
                    various foot races each year to challenge my physical
                    fitness in the same way I use my job to improve myself
                    mentally and socially. I believe that every moment is an
                    opportunity to learn and improve, and that philosophy drives
                    my performance in everything that I do.
                </p>
